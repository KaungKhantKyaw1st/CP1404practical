# Answers to questions:
# 1. What did you see on line 1?
# A random integer between 5 and 20 is displayed.
# 2. What was the smallest number you could have seen, what was the largest?
# The smallest number could be 5, and the largest could be 20.

# 3. What did you see on line 2?
# A random integer between 3 and 10 with differences of 2 is displayed.
# 4. What was the smallest number you could have seen, what was the largest?
# The smallest number could be 3, and the largest could be 9.
# 5. Could line 2 have produced a 4?
# No, it couldn't. It only produces odd numbers (3, 5, 7, 9).

# 6. What did you see on line 3?
# A random decimal number between 2.5 and 5.5 is displayed.
# 7. What was the smallest number you could have seen, what was the largest?
# The smallest number could be 2.5, and the largest could be just below 5.5.

# Generate and print a random integer between 1 and 100
random_number = random.randint(1, 100)
print(f"Random integer between 1 and 100: {random_number}")
